Symlink this folder to either /usr/share/ulauncher/themes or ~/.local/share/ulauncher/themes based on whether your ulauncher is for your system or user. Not sure about flatpak versions. Then just pick it in the preferences menu

You have to re-select the theme from the menu each time you make a change. Not sure how to avoid this as clearing the cache didn't work
